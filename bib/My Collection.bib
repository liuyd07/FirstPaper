abstract = {Similar to other cyber infrastructure systems, as wireless sensor networks become larger and more complex, many classic algorithms may no longer work efficiently. This paper presents a wireless sensor network time synchronization model that was initially inspired by synchronous flashing of fireflies. Synchronous flashing of fireflies is an interesting phenomenon that has been studied for decades. A variety of models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, among which is the pulse-coupled oscillators model that models fireflies as oscillators. The oscillators in such a model interact only through discrete pulses, similar to the flashing of fireflies. In this paper, we propose a new nonidentical linear pulse-coupled oscillators model and use the model to analyze synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators with different frequencies. The conditions to achieve and maintain synchronization are derived, and then, the results are used to prove that the oscillators in the model can achieve synchronization eventually, except for a set of frequencies with zero Lebesgue measure. Furthermore, through simulations and implementation on a wireless sensor network testbed, we demonstrate that the proposed nonidentical linear pulse-coupled oscillators model can be used in designing lightweight scalable time synchronization protocols for distributed systems.},

abstract = {The recent worldwide measures for energy savings call for a larger awareness of the household energy consumption, given the relevant contribution of domestic load to the national energy balance. On the other hand, electricity smart meters together with gas, heat, and water meters can be interconnected in a large network offering a potential value to implement energy savings and other energy-related services, as long as an efficient interface with the final user is implemented. Unfortunately, so far, the interface of such devices is mostly designed and addressed at the utilities supervising the system, giving them relevant advantages, while the communication with the household is often underestimated. This paper addresses this topic by proposing the definition of a local interface for smart meters, by looking at the actual European Union and international regulations, at the technological solutions available on the market, and at those implemented in different countries, and, finally, by proposing specific architectures for a proper consumer-oriented implementation of a smart meter network.},

abstract = {Policies to promote real-time metering (RTM) require more than showing benefits from more timely responses to variations in cost. They require positive externalities to imply that too few meters would be installed through private transactions. RTM presents no systematic externalities when utilities must serve peak period users, and may present negative externalities under some conditions. Positive externalities are likely when electricity is rationed through blackouts. RTM may or may not increase welfare when peak period wholesale markets are not competitive; a prohibition on RTM might be appropriate in such situations even if metering itself were costless.},

Advanced DMS assesses smart functions in the distribution system and is also responsible for assessing control functions such as reactive dispatch, voltage regulation, contingency analysis, capability maximization, or line switching. Optimal power flow (OPF)-based tools can be suitably adapted to the requirements of smart distribution network and be employed in an advanced DMS framework. In this paper, the authors present a methodology for unbalanced three-phase OPF (TOPF) for DMS in a smart grid. In the formulation of the TOPF, control variables of the optimization problem are actual active load demand and reactive power outputs of microgenerators. The TOPF is based on a quasi-Newton method and makes use of an open-source three-phase unbalanced distribution load flow.

abstract = {Robot systems are developed using various hardware and software components. In conventional design methodology, each hardware component and its software are strongly coupled such that it is not easy to replace or expand them separately. For the independent development and replacement of hardware and software components, this paper proposes a novel robot development methodology based on the abstractions of software and hardware components in a multilayer architecture for cyber-physical robot systems which conjoin computational and physical resources. We introduce a context generator and a behavior translator for the abstractions in the multilayer architecture. The context generator converts sensory value data into contexts using context scripts. The behavior translator converts a behavior, selected by a software agent that is a computer program deciding an action of a robot, into a sequence of actuator commands for robots using behavior scripts. These together enable two levels of abstraction in which software and hardware components can be developed independently of each other. As a result, software agents can work flawlessly even if hardware components are replaced and vice versa. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology are demonstrated through experiments, and the related applications are provided.},

The proposed method uses voltage and current phasors from feeder root and voltage sags measured at sparse nodes along the feeder, and pinpoints faults to the nearest node. Decision-tree (DT)-based fault segment identification is introduced before the process of node selection to reduce the computational complexity and improve fault-location accuracy. The method has been implemented on a practical distribution system and tested under a large number of fault scenarios. Test results are compared with those from the traditional voltage-sag-based fault-location algorithm using the same inputs, and the conclusion is that the proposed method can achieve more reliable results while maintaining computational simplicity. A quantitative method to suggest the optimal placement of measurement units based on the DT variable importance is proposed at the end.},

abstract = {This paper presents Glossy, a novel flooding architecture for wireless sensor networks. Glossy exploits constructive interference of IEEE 802.15.4 symbols for fast network flooding and implicit time synchronization. We derive a timing requirement to make concurrent transmissions of the same packet interfere constructively, allowing a receiver to decode the packet even in the absence of capture effects. To satisfy this requirement, our design temporally decouples flooding from other network activities. We analyze Glossy using a mixture of statistical and worst-case models, and evaluate it through experiments under controlled settings and on three wireless sensor testbeds. Our results show that Glossy floods packets within a few milliseconds and achieves an average time synchronization error below one microsecond. In most cases, a node receives the flooding packet with a probability higher than 99.99\%, while having its radio turned on for only a few milliseconds during a flood. Moreover, unlike existing flooding schemes, Glossy's performance exhibits no noticeable dependency on node density, which facilitates its application in diverse real-world settings.},

This paper classifies and defines performance requirements for the protocols used in a process bus on the basis of application. These include Generic Object Oriented Substation Event, Simple Network Management Protocol, and Sampled Values (SVs). A method, based on the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) and virtual local area networks, is presented that separates management and monitoring traffic from the rest of the process bus. A quantitative investigation of the interaction between various protocols used in a process bus is described. These tests also validate the effectiveness of the MSTP-based traffic segregation method. While this paper focuses on a substation automation network, the results are applicable to other real-time industrial networks that implement multiple protocols. High-volume SV data and time-critical circuit breaker tripping commands do not interact on a full-duplex switched Ethernet network, even under very high network load conditions. This enables an efficient digital network to replace a large number of conventional analog connections between control rooms and high-voltage switchyards.},

abstract = {Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an important component of the smart grid. The cyber security should be considered prior to the AMI system applications. To ensure confidentiality and integrality, a key management scheme (KMS) for a large amount of smart meters (SMs) and devices is required, which is not a properly solved problem until now. Compared with other systems, there are three specific features of AMI that should be carefully considered, including hybrid transmission modes of messages, storage and computation constraints of SMs, and unfixed participators in demand response (DR) projects. In order to deal with security requirements and considering the distinctive features, a novel KMS is proposed. First, the key management framework of an AMI system is constructed based on the key graph. Furthermore, three different key management processes are designed to deal with the hybrid transmission modes, including key management for unicast, broadcast, and multicast modes. Relatively simple cryptographic algorithms are chosen for key generation and refreshing policies due to the storage and computation constraints of SMs. Specific key refreshing policies are designed since the participators in a certain DR project are not fixed. Finally, the security and performance of the KMS are analyzed. According to the results, the proposed scheme is a possible solution for AMI systems.},

abstract = {Mobile sensor node deployment and power management are important issues in the wireless sensor network system. This study designs a mobile sensor node platform to achieve a highly accurate localization mechanism by using ultrasonic, dead reckoning, and radio frequency information which is processed through a particle filter algorithm. Mobile sensor node with accurate localization ability is of great interest to basic research works and applications, such as sensor deployment, coverage management, dynamic power management, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient mobile sensor node deployment method, grid deployment, where the map is divided into multiple individual grids and the weight of each grid is determined by environmental factors such as predeployed nodes, boundaries, and obstacles. The grid with minimum values is the goal of the mobile node. We also design an asynchronous power management strategy in our sensor node to reduce power consumption of the sensor network. Several factors such as probability of event generation, battery status, coverage issues, and communication situations have also been taken into consideration. In network communication, we propose an asynchronous awakening scheme so that each node is free to switch on or off its components according to observed event statistics and make a tradeoff between communication and power consumption. The deepest sleep state period is determined by the residual power. By combining these methods, the power consumption of the sensor node can be reduced.},

@article{Paudyal2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a generic and comprehensive distribution optimal power flow (DOPF) model that can be used by local distribution companies (LDCs) to integrate their distribution system feeders into a Smart Grid. The proposed three-phase DOPF framework incorporates detailed modeling of distribution system components and considers various operating objectives. Phase specific and voltage dependent modeling of customer loads in the three-phase DOPF model allows LDC operators to determine realistic operating strategies that can improve the overall feeder efficiency. The proposed distribution system operation objective is based on the minimization of the energy drawn from the substation while seeking to minimize the number of switching operations of load tap changers and capacitors. A novel method for solving the three-phase DOPF model by transforming the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to a nonlinear programming problem is proposed which reduces the computational burden and facilitates its practical implementation and application. Two practical case studies, including a real distribution feeder test case, are presented to demonstrate the features of the proposed methodology. The results illustrate the benefits of the proposed DOPF in terms of reducing energy losses while limiting the number of switching operations.},

@article{Sauter2011,
abstract = {Smart grids heavily depend on communication in order to coordinate the generation, distribution, and consumption of energy-even more so if distributed power plants based on renewable energies are taken into account. Given the variety of communication partners, a heterogeneous network infrastructure consisting of IP-based and suitable field-level networks is the most appropriate solution. This paper investigates such a two-tier infrastructure and possible field-level networks with particular attention to metering and supervisory control and data acquisition applications. For the problem of network integration, a combination of gateway and tunneling solutions is proposed which allows a semitransparent end-to-end connection between application servers and field nodes. The feasibility of the approach and implementation details are discussed at the example of powerline communication and IP-based networks investigated in the European research project on real-time energy management via powerlines and internet. Nevertheless, it is shown that the communication architecture is versatile enough to serve as a generic solution for smart grids.},

@article{Scaglione2005,
abstract = {Synchronization is considered a particularly difficult task in wireless sensor networks due to its decentralized structure. Interestingly, synchrony has often been observed in networks of biological agents (e.g., synchronously flashing fireflies, or spiking of neurons). In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired network synchronization protocol for large scale sensor networks that emulates the simple strategies adopted by the biological agents. The strategy synchronizes pulsing devices that are led to emit their pulses periodically and simultaneously. The convergence to synchrony of our strategy follows from the theory of Mirollo and Strogatz, 1990, while the scalability is evident from the many examples existing in the natural world. When the nodes are within a single broadcast range, our key observation is that the dependence of the synchronization time on the number of nodes N is subject to a phase transition: for values of N beyond a specific threshold, the synchronization is nearly immediate; while for smaller N, the synchronization time decreases smoothly with respect to N. Interestingly, a tradeoff is observed between the total energy consumption and the time necessary to reach synchrony. We obtain an optimum operating point at the local minimum of the energy consumption curve that is associated to the phase transition phenomenon mentioned before. The proposed synchronization protocol is directly applied to the cooperative reach-back communications problem. The main advantages of the proposed method are its scalability and low complexity.},

It supports functions such as fusing voice and video data from different sensor nodes, time-based channel sharing, and coordinated sleep wake-up node scheduling mechanisms. Early studies on clock synchronization for WSNs mainly focused on protocol design. However, the clock synchronization problem is inherently related to parameter estimation, and, recently, studies on clock synchronization began to emerge by adopting a statistical signal processing framework. In this article, a survey on the latest advances in the field of clock synchronization of WSNs is provided by following a signal processing viewpoint. This article illustrates that many of the proposed clock synchronization protocols can be interpreted and their performance assessed using common statistical signal processing methods. It is also shown that advanced signal processing techniques enable the derivation of optimal clock synchronization algorithms under challenging scenarios.},
